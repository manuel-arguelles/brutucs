# BruTuCs

This is a toy project aimed to act as a kata to learn and play with tools that I don't get to use in my day-to-day work:

- Meson build system
- Catch2 unit testing framework

The idea is to generate btc addresses and compare them with a list of known addresses to try to find an collision. In theory the chance of that is very small, almost impossible.

## Does this work?

Absolutely not, this is for fun, not for profit.
